sysvinit

The source tree you are looking at now came from here:
    https://github.com/dcantrell/sysvinit

This tree was imported from code from here:
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/sysvinit
and then updated to be a little more modern and dump some of the old
baggage.


WHY

Don't we have plenty of sysvinit replacements?  Yes, we do.  But I still use
sysvinit and I don't see a reason to stop using it on my systems.  I am
really just keeping this project in maintenance mode and making sure it
still compiles and runs fine on modern systems.  If you have patches, send
merge requests and I will evaluate them.


VERSION

At the time of my fork of the code, the released version of sysvinit was at
2.88dsf.  I decided to drop the 'dsf' since it was really sort of pointless
anyway and add a .z version number.  I do not intend to make any significant
changes to the code to warrant a new x.y version number.  Convince me
otherwise if you disagree.


QUESTIONS

Direct questions for this fork to David Cantrell <david.l.cantrell@gmail.com>
I have not talked to the current developers of sysvinit or the original
author, so they are likely unaware of this fork.
