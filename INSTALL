Installation follows the usual autoconf methods:

    ./configure [options]
    make
    make install

See ./configure --help for available options.  Aside from the usual path and
build options, here are some specific to dcsysvinit:

    --enable-selinux (default is no)
        Use this if installing on a system with SELinux support.

    --enable-accton (default is no)
        Tells the shutdown(8) command that it should run accton(8) to turn
        off accounting as part of the shutdown procedure.  Many systems
        handle this via an init script, but Debian systems do it this way
        (maybe?  this was under the Debian CFLAGS in the old src/Makefile).

    --enable-sysfs (default is yes)
        Use sysfs (/sys) for disk device discovery.  This is 'yes' by
        default since it is 2014 as I type this and we all have sysfs.

    --enable-sanetio (default is yes)
        Disable flow control, ignore break, and make nl/cr more usable.
        This is 'yes' by default but was previously under the 'SuSE' CFLAGS
        section in the old src/Makefile.

    --enable-sigint_onlyonce (default is no)
        Enable SIGINT handling via the keyboard in init(8).  This is an odd
        one and I do not totally understand it as I write this, but it was
        from the SuSE CFLAGS section in the old src/Makefile.  If it does
        not make sense, I will remove it later.

The options above have corresponding --disable-OPTION modes to disable that
feature at build time.
